I like food. I like eating it, I like talking about it, and I like making food, and I like building things, so here's a full website about food.

Deciding what to cook is the hardest part of making dinner, so I use this website as a source of inspiration and to collect meals that we enjoyed or turned out nice.

And finally, I often try recipes or make variations and I need a place to record these, so I'll turn this into my public recipe collection and culinary notebook.
