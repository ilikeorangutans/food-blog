## Why?

I like food. I like eating it, I like talking about it, and I like making food, and I like building things, so here's a full website about food.

Deciding what to cook is the hardest part of making dinner, so I use this website as a source of inspiration and to collect meals that we enjoyed or turned out nice.

And finally, I often try recipes or make variations and I need a place to record these, so I'll turn this into my public recipe collection and culinary notebook.

## Why not Instagram?

Instagram is not the right format for this. It's too... fleeting, unorganized, driven too much by vanity. What I want to build is a compendium of things I made, possibly with notes and maybe a list of culinary resources that I find useful. I miss the "old" internet, where people had interesting, fun blogs where you could just read interesting thoughts. And webrings, where you could go from one site about a specific topic to another one. When you found a good blog post and it was part of a ring, it felt like you hit a goldmine. I like this format and I'd like to build something like this again. This blog is the first step.

## How?

I built this blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast static site generator, using trusty Vim as an editor. If you're interested you can look at the [sources of this blog on Github](https://github.com/ilikeorangutans/food-blog). The statically generated files are then uploaded to a Google Cloud storage bucket.

There's no tracking. There's no cookies. There's no ads.
