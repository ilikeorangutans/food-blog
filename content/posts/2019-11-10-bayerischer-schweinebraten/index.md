I really loved this dish as a kid so I figured I could make it myself. And it turns out it's acutally quite simple.

I used pork shoulder because that's what I had at hand. Preheated the oven to 400&deg; F. Patted the roast try and rubbed it with salt, pepper, and caraway seeds. Placed it in a roasting pan and surrounded it with carrots, onion, and leeks and filled it up with some stock and a can of dark beer. Keep filling it up with beer and stock until the roast is at temperature. The pan drippings then get strained into a pot and simmered down for gravy.

I've made this roast again and seared the meat before I roasted it, that made it even better. I didn't take pictures, but believe me, it was great.
