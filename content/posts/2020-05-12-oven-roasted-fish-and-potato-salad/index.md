Made the oven roasted fish with tomatoes from the [New York Times Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020454-one-pan-roasted-fish-with-cherry-tomatoes) [again]({{< relref "posts/2020-04-23-dinner-oven-roasted-fish-with-cherry-tomatoes-and-potato-gratin" >}}), this time with Tilapia. I love this recipe. It's fast, easy, and you can throw some asparagus or other quick veggies in the oven and you're done.

I also made a really nice potato salad with these mini potatoes that came out really nice. I used ~2 cups of mayo, vinegar, salt, pepper, mini pickles, some finely chopped celery, a boiled egg, and a bunch of herbs and spices that I don't fully remember anymore. Mixing the freshly cooked potatoes with dressing helped everything coat really well, and we at that potato salad for probably 4 days and enjoyed every bit of it.
