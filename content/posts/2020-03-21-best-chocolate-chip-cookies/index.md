I got a recommendation for this chocolate chip cookie recipe titled [how to make perfect chocolate chip cookies](https://tasty.co/recipe/tasty-101-ultimate-brown-butter-chocolate-chip-cookies). I made them today and while they were not perfect, they were still pretty good.

I followed the recipe with the exception of the espresso powder (which I don't have on hand) and the resting phase of the dough.

What I liked:

* The browned butter adds a complex flavour to it and browning butter is always fun (and smells great).
* &frac23; brown sugar and &frac13; white sugar is nice.
* They are actually really tasty and I ate two.

What I didn't like:

* They came out rather thin; this might be because I didn't actually refrigerate the dough but I baked only half and the other half is in the freezer. My gut feeling is that the cold ones will spread less than the warm ones.
* It was a little too salty. The recipe calls for 2 Tsp of kosher salt which is actually quite a lot. If I make this again, I'll definitely use less salt.
* They seemed greasy, more so than the cookies I usually make.
