Made [King Arthur Flower's corn bread](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/cornbread-recipe) in muffin form and spruced it up by adding shredded cheese, ham, and green onions. A little garlic and onion powder was a good addition. Could have used a little more cheese and green onion.

They're great as a quick on-the-go breakfast or with a salad. Quite enjoy these.
