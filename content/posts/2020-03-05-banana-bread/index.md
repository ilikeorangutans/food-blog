Had some ripe bananas, so I made banana bread. This recipe is from [ricardo cuisine](https://www.ricardocuisine.com/en/recipes/6085-ultra-moist-banana-bread) and makes a really, really moist loaf, almost like a bread pudding. Maybe I should try this with a little less butter. I used a little more banana, and only a quarter of the sugar because it's meant as a snack for the toddler (even though we ate like a third of it already).
