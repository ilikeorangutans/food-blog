Costco had an AirFryer for less than $100 so I decided to give it a try. I'm usually reluctant to countertop appliances as they take up plenty of space and their function can be performed by other tools that I already have. Airfryers however have been getting rave reviews so caved and got it.

Airfryers are in essence convection ovens that blow heated air on your food. And while I have an oven with convection function, the ability of this airfryer to come up to temp in minutes and not heat up the entire house is great. I've made a few things since I got it and it excels at anything you'd deep fry or bake in dry heat. Some of the things I made are:

- sandwiches: they come out crispy with melted cheese
- french fries: crispy, almost too crispy because I kept them in there too long.
- baked fish: Parmesan crusted Tilapia. Quite delicious and crunchy.
- [mushrooms](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/275679/air-fryer-mushrooms/): much easier than trying to evenly brown them in a pan
- chocolate chip cookies: I had some cookie dough in the freezer and popped them in the fryer. They were slightly underbaked
- reheated pizza: it's like fresh out of the oven!

Overall, I quite like this device. It's fast to heat up, and the things it does, it does generally really well. I wish it had a bigger basket so I could make more than just a single portion of something in it but I suppose that's the price you pay for a small countertop appliance.
