Sunday was prep day so I made a lot of food for the next days.

## Quiche

I made quiche again, this time with panchetta, mushrooms, and thyme.

For the crust I used less water this time and the crust came out softer and flakier than the last time.

**Key Differences:**
* grated the frozen butter like they thought us in culinary school, makes making the crust a lot easier
* Less water. Recipe calls for 100 ml of ice water, `+/-`. I went with roughly 120 ml because the flour was very dry. Last time I probably used 180 ml and that led to a tough crust.
* Longer blind bake: went with 17 minutes blind bake, made the crust nice and flaky
* Added a tablespoon of sugar to the pastry in the hopes it would lead to nicer browning. Got almost none of that, starting to think 350&deg; F is not hot enough to properly caramelize sugar in that amount of time. Need to look into at what temperature sugar caramelizes.

## Roasted Veggies

Roasted carrots, parsnip, and squash at 400&deg; for ~30 minutes. They all came out too hard. Next time roast at higher temp, maybe 425&deg; F. Seasoning was nice though, oil, salt, dried basil, pepper, garlic and onion powder.

## Baked Salmon

Made baked salmon following [African Bite's](https://www.africanbites.com/oven-baked-salmon/) recipe and it was delicious. Love this recipe because the roasting time and temperature makes for perfectly juicy salmon fillets: _400&deg; F for 10-15 minutes_ or until easily flaked with a fork.

I like their glaze, but I wonder if other flavours would be as nice. Maybe lemon, capers, and dill next time?

## Greek Yoghurt Dessert

Felt like a dessert after dinner so I mixed some Greek yoghurt, condensed milk, and lemon juice to taste. Added some graham cracker crumbs to the bottom of the bowl, poured yoghurt over, and garnished. Was very tasty, almost like lemon posset, just a little lighter.
