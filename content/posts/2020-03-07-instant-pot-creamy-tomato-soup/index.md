Saw a post about Instant Pot tomato soup on [/r/instantpot](https://www.reddit.com/r/instantpot/) and had to try it.

Recipe is from [Recipe Teacher](https://recipeteacher.com/instant-pot-creamy-tomato-basil-soup), just beware, if you just want the recipe, there's a lot of filler to go over. There's even a section where they talk about the invention of American Cheese.

I didn't have fire roasted tomatoes at hand so I substituted San Marzano tomatoes and it came out great. Hannah said she'd like it a little creamier, so next time I'll add more yoghurt. I do wonder where to get fire roasted tomatoes and how that would impact flavor. Maybe that could be emulated by searing some tomato paste with the onions?
