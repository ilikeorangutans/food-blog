I had a lot of pasta sheets leftover from yesterday's [Lasagna-feast]({{< relref "posts/2020-04-04-lasagna-and-other-adventures-in-pasta" >}}). Like a lot. But sadly no more meat sauce. I figured there's white pizza so I could definitely make a white lasagna. The overall idea was to make a Bechamel sauce but infuse it with shallots and leeks, just because I had some in my fridge. I think sun-dried  tomatoes would have been really good in this, but I didn't have any, so I went for roasted red peppers. Roasting them at home is kind of a pain if you don't have a gas burner, but turns out you can just throw them under the broiler, pretty much as good as over a gas burner. Thanks to the friendly culinary folks that gave me that idea.

As for the sauce I started with thin slices of chicken breast that I browned in batches in a large pot. Once all chicken was browned, I added finely chopped shallots, garlic, roasted bell peppers, and leeks, cooked for a minute or two, deglazed with some chicken stock. Added some more butter, flour, cooked that down, and added milk and built up the bechamel sauce, except I added milk and chicken stock so that makes it like half bechamel, half veloute. Yeah, this is a weird experiment, but it turned out so pretty. Added the chicken back in, let it thicken and then assembled the lasagna.

**Side note**: All the pasta sheets had stuck together... a great way to get them to separate is to pour hot water over them, they come easily apart.

Into the lasagna I added sauce, mozzarella cheese, sliced zucchini, and some spinach. Served with green beans.

Pretty happy with how that came out.
