Needed to change up breakfast a little and because we had just stocked up on yogurt I decided to make parfaits. Made granola based with [Cookie and Kate's](https://cookieandkate.com/healthy-granola-recipe/) recipe and it came out great. I added pecans and shredded coconut.  It's so yummy that we probably ate half of it as a snack. Then stacked up the parfait with yogurt, sliced peaches, strawberries, and the granola.
