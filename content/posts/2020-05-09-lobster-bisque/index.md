We got gifted some live lobster so I boiled them. But then I had all the shells left over so I figured I'll make a Lobster Bisque. I only watched the chef at Culinary II make it and this was my first time making it myself. It came out ok-ish, but I didn't have fish stock so the flavour is not as full as it should be. The texture is nice, but took a lot of beurre manie because I added too much liquid.

All in all it isn't bad, but just so much work. Lobster in general is just so much work and not for the squeamish. Would I make it again? Probably not, mostly because I wouldn't buy Lobster in the first place and secondly because it is a really rich soup, so rich that we'll be eating this for days.
