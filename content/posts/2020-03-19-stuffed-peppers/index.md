Bell peppers stuffed with ground beef, carrot, onion, bell pepper, rice, and celery in tomato sauce. And, because everybody likes it, covered with cheese. This time with _extra_ cheese. I don't really have a recipe for this so every time it's slightly different. This time it came out very nice, so I'm gonna note it down here:

## Ingredients
- ~ 500g of lean ground beef
- 4 bell peppers, cored. I take the top parts and dice them and add them in too
- 2 sticks of celery, diced
- 1 large carrot, diced
- ~1 cup of rice, cooked
- 1 onion, diced
- 3 cloves of garlic
- 1 can of tomatoes, pureed
- Salt
- Black Pepper
- Paprika
- Smoked Paprika
- Thyme
- Red wine vinegar
- maybe half a cup of beef broth

## Method

1. Brown meat in batches, set aside
2. Into the same pot, add onion, some salt and sweat a little, then add garlic
3. Deglaze with red wine vinegar and some beef broth
4. Add the beef, remaining vegetables, pepper, paprika, smoked paprika, thyme
5. Cook until all tender
7. Add seasoning as needed, then stuff the peppers with the filling (I had extra which is always nice)
8. Deglazed again with beef broth, then poured tomatoes into the same pot. Sit stuffed peppers in the sauce, cover them with cheese
9. Cooked for maybe 10 minutes, which wasn't quite enough to make the bell peppers really soft. Maybe next time I should aim for 20 minutes.
10. 3 minutes under the broiler to melt and brown the cheese

## Notes

* Because I was in a rush I put the uncooked bell peppers on top of the vegetables as they were cooking, steaming them. That was neat and made this whole dish a lot faster.
* I had a lot of fond build up which I kept deglazing with beef stock, and just poured the tomato sauce on it. The resulting tomato sauce turned out really flavourful
* Normally I throw this in the oven, but cooking it on the stove top is a lot faster
