I was shopping for groceries and there was a sale on cream cheese. Naturally I decided to make cheese cake because why not.

I followed the [Instant Pot Cheesecake #17
recipe](https://www.pressurecookrecipes.com/instant-pot-cheesecake-new-york/)
and as usually it turned out incredible. I have to give them credit for putting
up a recipe that's to the point, full of actually good tips and hints and
offers you several paths depending on how dedicated you are to your cake's
creaminess.

I opted to blind bake the crust which makes it nice and crunchy which I greatly
prefer over soggy graham crackers. The cream cheese packages added up to 500g
of cream cheese, slightly more than the recipe calls for, but that wasn't an
issue, just means more cake filling.

To top it all off, I made a quick blueberry compote. About a cup to a cup and a
half of Blueberries, a little sugar, lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Bring to
a boil over medium heat and cook until the berries are starting to break down.
Whisk in a little corn starch mixed with cold water and continue simmering until
nice and thick.
Let cool slightly and add a dash of vanilla. The compote had a little more
lemon juice than intended but that just made it extra good. Will do that again.
