## Greek Lemon Potatoes

Last night I finally tried making Greek lemon potatoes with lots of helpful input from some culinary folks at work. They came out pretty good, though not quite as lemony as I would like them to be. Baking time was also a lot longer than expected, maybe because I didn't have enough liquid in there at the beginning.

### Ingredients

- 2 or 3 pounds of potatoes, cut into thick wedges
- 2 or 3 cups of chicken stock
- half a cup of olive oil
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- plenty of oregano
- lemon juice - I eyeballed that one, maybe half a cup?
- salt and pepper, to taste
- a few bay leaves

### Method

1. Preheat oven to 400&deg; F
2. Toss potatoes with oil, garlic, oregano, lemon juice, salt, pepper
3. Place potatoes in baking dish, fill up with stock, add bay leaves, cover with aluminum foil, place in oven
4. After 30 minutes take foil of and cook another 30 to 60 minutes or until tender
5. Broil for 2 or 3 minutes to get some color

### Changes for next time

- parcook potatoes half way
- add whole lemon slices into the liquid
- braise at lower temperature for longer, maybe 350&deg; F for 2 hours
- add rosemary and thyme sprigs


## Roasted Seabass and Asparagus

Made roasted asparagus and roasted seabass to go with the potatoes. Roasted seabass as per [this previous post]({{<ref "posts/2019-09-15-roasted-seabass">}}).

The roasted asparagus was easy and came out great too. Washed asparagus, tossed with oil, salt, pepper, and baked at 400&deg;F for 10-12 minutes. All stalks came out equally tender. Not as flavourful as pan fried, but requires a lot less attention.

## Bananabread

And finally, because we had a few very ripe bananas I made our favorite [banana bread recipe]({{<ref "posts/2020-03-05-banana-bread">}}).
