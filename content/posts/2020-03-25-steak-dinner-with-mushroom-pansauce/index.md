We felt fancy (and I bought steaks from Costco) so we had ourselves a nice steak dinner. First time making steaks in a while and I really enjoyed the process. Proper Mise en Place before I started, got the cast iron pan to the right temperature , timed everything well and as the steaks rested I made a mushroom pan sauce that was pretty good. Served the steaks with steamed green beans and leftover lemon potatoes.

## Notes Steak

- Preheated cast iron pan a while before I started, it was slightly smoking before I put anything in it. Heat was on medium high.
- Steak cooked 4 minutes each side and it came out pretty much medium rare
- Salted the steaks an hour prior to cooking, that seems to have led to a nice crust

## Pan Sauce

- Didn't have cognac or brandy so I just used overproof rum
- Added mushrooms, chopped shallot, and garlic into pan as steaks where resting, cooked down, deglazed with the rum, added some beef stock and cream, a small dollop of Dijon mustard to help emulsify the fats. Salt, pepper, done.
