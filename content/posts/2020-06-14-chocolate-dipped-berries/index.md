One of my favorite treats to make in the summer when fresh and flavorful berries are easily available. In the photo are chocolate covered strawberries and blueberries.

Prepare your berries of choice by washing and then thoroughly drying them. You want to avoid getting water into the chocolate later. Ideally, place them in the fridge or freezer for a short while to cool them down. This will help the chocolate solidify quickly.

Melt some chocolate over a double boiler and temper it. Don't get it too hot or it'll seize up. Dip your dry, cold fruit into the chocolate, let the excess drip off, or not, and place on a plate/tray. Let cool for a while for the chocolate to set.
