Our go-to vegetable side dish: sauteed spinach with garlic. Takes just a few minutes of prep time and cooks in less than 5.

You'll need minced garlic (however much you like), spinach leaves, oil, salt. Heat up pan with oil, add garlic when hot and saut√© for like a minute, add spinach, and cook until all wilted. Season with salt, add a little bit of olive oil.
