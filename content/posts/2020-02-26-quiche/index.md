We needed something for breakfast and I had just the perfect ingredients for a quiche: spinach, panchetta, mushrooms, and cheese.

So I pulled out my recipe from Culinary Arts, whipped up a crust, sauteed the filling with shallots and filled a very pretty quiche.

## Pie Pastry

### Ingredients
* 300 g flour
* 150 g butter, cold (could also use lard, vegetable shortening)
* 3 g salt
* &plusmn; 100 g ice water

**Note**: adding a little bit of sugar helps brown the crust. I didn't add any for this crust, so it's rather pale.
**Note**: blind baking helps with the crust crispiness

### Method

1. Mix flour and salt
2. Add fat, mix with flour by hand, or forks, until pea sized nuggets
3. Add water, just enough to form a ball, do not overwork
4. Chill for at least half an hour before rolling out

## Quiche

### Ingredients
* Cheese (Gruyere, Emmentaler, anything really)
* 4 Eggs
* 170 ml Milk
* 15 g Butter
* &half; onion or shallot, finely diced
* Herbs (dill, basil, rosemary, thyme, ...)
* Nutmeg
* Salt
* Pepper

### Method
1. Break eggs and beat well, add seasoning
2. Scald milk, stir slowly into eggs
3. Place cheese on pastry
4. Add garnish
5. Pour egg mixture in shell, sprinkle with herbs
6. Bake at 350&deg; F for ~20 minutes or until set
