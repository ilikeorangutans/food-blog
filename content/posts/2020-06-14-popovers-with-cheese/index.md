A long time ago we went to a fancy steakhouse and they served us these fancy bread things as a side and I've been thinking about these lately.

One day "popovers" _popped_ into my head and as I had planned a steak dinner for that night, I looked around and found [The Spruce Eats' Recipe](https://www.thespruceeats.com/popover-cheese-variation-3053772) for classic popovers. Three ingredients and a pretty much hands off method sold me, so I whipped up the batter before I made dinner, _popped_ them into the oven and by the time everything else was ready, the popovers were done.

They beautifully _popped_ out of their ramekin and were delicious. I had sprinkled some Gruyere on them and they were a hit.
