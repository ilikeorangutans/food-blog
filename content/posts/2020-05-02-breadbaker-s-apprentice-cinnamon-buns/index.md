I love cinnamon buns. I usually make a recipe that I found on the internet and the results are not bad. Today I was craving cinnamon buns and decided to give the recipe from on of my favorite books, [The Bread Baker's Apprentice](https://www.amazon.ca/Bread-Bakers-Apprentice-15th-Anniversary/dp/1607748657), a try. And man did they not disappoint. The texture and consistency of the buns was almost brioche like and might be the best I've made so far.

I did make some slight changes though:
* I spread a thin layer of soft butter on the rolled out dough before sprinkling the cinnamon-sugar mix on.
* I layered some more butter on the bottom of the pan, spread some coarse chopped pecans and some brown sugar on it before placing the rolls on top. The result was nicely caramelized and candied pecans at the bottom.

I made the flat icing described in the book but found that the 4 cups (!) of icing sugar were way to much, so I made maybe 2 cups or so and still had left overs. The icing, while lemony, adds a lot of sweetness to the rolls, so next time I'll probably make a cream cheese icing which is a little less sweet.

At this point I've eaten three of these in less than 6 hours.
