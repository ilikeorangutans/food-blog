Made Chicken Cacciatore using [Cafe Delites](https://cafedelites.com/chicken-cacciatore/) recipe and creamy zucchini to go with it.

Didn't have time to simmer the cacciatore too long, only 30 minutes or so, and no black olives, but it still came out great. The red wine I used was a little on the acidic side so I added a pinch or two of sugar to even that out. Definitely going to make this again. Next time I'd probably add a bay leaf or two, and fresh herbs would be a great addition.

To go with the chicken I sauteed zucchini with onion and lots of garlic. I actually salted them to draw out moisture and then proceeded to dump both zucchini and the water in the pan. Not smart. However, having to cook all the water of led to an almost syrupy liquid covering the zucchini, so I'm not sure that was a loss. I'll have to experiment with that.
