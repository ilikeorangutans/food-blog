One of my favorite ways of making fish. Not really a recipe, more of a technique of preparing whole fish.

1. Preheat oven to 450&deg; F
2. Pat dry fish, cut skin diagonally 2-3 centimeters apart, brush with oil
3. Season liberally with salt, pepper, garlic, whatever you have. Rub it into all crevices
4. Stuff with herbs (basil, dill, parsley, cilantro all work well), lemon slices
5. Roast 18-20 minutes or until flaky
6. Squeeze lemon juice and eat fresh
