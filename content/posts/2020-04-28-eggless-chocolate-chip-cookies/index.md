I had been craving chocolate chip cookies all day and decided to make some after dinner. However, no eggs left in the fridge so I used this [recipe](https://www.keepinglifesane.com/best-eggless-chocolate-chip-cookies/) instead. The cookies came out nicely. I baked them longer than the recipe prescribed -- 16 minutes vs 12 minutes -- just to get some color on them. The texture was nice, slightly crispy on the outside, but still chewy on the inside.

Definitely satisfying, but flavor wise they are a bit flat I find. But should I ever be out of eggs again, these will do.
