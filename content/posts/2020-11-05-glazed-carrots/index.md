We got these beautiful heirloom carrots from a farmer that sells the best sweet corn at the side of the road. A side was needed and I recalled watching Thomas Keller's Masterclass about glazed carrots and decided to go with that.

The process is simple: cut your carrots (I went with oblique cut) and bring them to a boil with just enough water to cover them. Cook until most of the water is gone, add butter and some sugar, keep cooking on low heat until they are covered by the syrup and shiny. Add a little salt and Parsley. Voila.
