We got a turkey as a gift and I figured today is as good as a day as any other to make it. I've done chickens but never a full turkey, but it works just like the smaller birds. Spatchcocking, or butterflying, makes it easier to cook evenly and faster, and is probably my favorite way roasting poultry.

# Turkey and Gravy

I spatchcocked it and roasted over some carrots, onion and celery for some gravy. I don't really have a roasting pan, so a cooling rack and a sheetpan had to do. At 450&deg;F this bird roasted in less than 80 minutes. Made a quick turkey stock from the neck and backbones, giblets, and some extra mirepoix with dried thyme. Simmered that for maybe an hour and then strained it. Made a roux with ~30g butter and flour each and cooked until browned, could probably have gone a little darker, filled up with the stock and some extra chicken stock. Again, dried thyme, a dash of Worcestershire sauce and a dash of soy sauce for a little extra umami, dash of red wine vinegar, and it came out with a nice, gravy like consistency and full flavor.

## Times and Temperatures

Noting this down because I'll need these again.

Roasting temp 450&deg;F, time 80-90 minutes or until internal temp at breast is 150&deg;F (65&deg;C) and thighs at least 165&deg;F (73&deg;C).

# Stuffing

Didn't want to serve turkey without stuffing, but with a spatchcocked turkey you have to make the stuffing separately. I roughly followed [this recipe](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/easy-stuffing-recipe/) and used the fresh turkey stock I was cooking. Also used shallots, just because I like them. I roasted the bread cubes for ~10 minutes in the oven with the turkey, sprinkled with the stock and then roasted it again in the oven with the turkey. The oven was at a higher temperature than the recipe called for and I didn't watch the time too closely, but probably 20 or 30 minutes. Took it out and it was nicely cooked. Not too dry, not too moist. Hannah even said it tasted like boxed stuffing, a great compliment according to her. I call that a success.
