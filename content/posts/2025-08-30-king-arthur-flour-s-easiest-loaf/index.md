Recently I've started making [King Arthur Flour's Easiest Loaf](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/the-easiest-loaf-of-bread-youll-ever-bake-recipe) and we're very much enjoying it. I do roughly half whole wheat flour, half bread flour, and the result is a light, fluffy, bread with a flavorful crust.

Highly recommend this recipe, the dough is not too wet and easy to work with. Shaping takes a bit of practice, but even mishappen loafs are tasty.
