Something different today. Picked up this curry paste a few weeks ago at Walmart. It caught my eye because of its ingredients: shallots, chili, coriander, etc, all things I would use in a curry paste as well. It came out pretty good. You simmer this paste in coconut milk with your favorite cut of meat, potatoes, and I just added some cauliflower. You finish it with fish sauce (good that I had some at hand).

It's nice. It's not the best curry but definitely not the worst. Only complaint is that it's slightly on the salty side (so don't season). It only makes 2 portions so next time I'm definitely going to pick up more.
