I started to see a lot of content by Jacques Pépin recommended by YouTube. Can you tell? I watch a lot of food related things. Anyways, this video about making Crêpes showed up and it might be the way Jacques demonstrates it or the fact that this reminds me very much of the pancakes I ate as a kid, but decided I had to make it.

Then one Saturday morning I decided to prepare the crépes. They were quick to make and I stuffed some of them with onion, some leftover turkey and some cheese. The rest we ate with jam. Breakfast was a success and we really enjoyed it.

I'll be on the lookout for more great recipes by Pépin and already added [Crêpes Suzette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUIZ_XhmxYg) to my list of things to prepare.
