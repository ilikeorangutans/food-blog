Felt like making Schnitzel so I got some pork chops. Had originally planned to serve them with a mushroom sauce but ran out of time, so we had them with Spätzle sauteed with butter.

## Spätzle Notes

- Batter was too thin initially, had to add more flour and mix a lot more. Not sure if the eggs added more liquid or if I didn't work it enough.
- Process was messy, need to improve my workflow here. Using a ladle worked ok, but lots of dripping. I wonder if I could use something like a squeeze bottle or pour it from a pitcher?
- Lots of batter stuck to the Spätzlehobel. A rubber spatula worked really well working that batter through it.

## Schnitzel Notes

- Use the biggest plates you can find for drenching!
- One schnitzel wasn't fully thinned out, need to make sure they are hammered thin everywhere
- Try the textured side of the mallet next time
- Oil temperate was off; initially too hot, in the end a little too cold. Some quick research suggest 170&deg;C (~340&deg;F). Need to find a good fry thermometer that can go on the pan.
- Texture and crunch was pretty good, I only added salt though. Adding a little water to the eggwash worked well and helped souffleing the crust.
