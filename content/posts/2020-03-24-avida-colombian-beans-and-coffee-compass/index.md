Normally I'd buy my coffee beans from _Merchants of Green Coffee_ (I just realized they don't even have a website) but unfortunately they are inaccessible to me right now. Thanks, Covid. So out of necessity I grabbed a bag of Avida Colombian Beans from Costco. Made a cup yesterday with my Aeropress using the inverted method. 12 g of coffee, 93&deg; C water, steeped for ~60 seconds. The aroma is _nice_. But the coffee has a slightly bitter note to it and I've been thinking that I read something about a coffee map or quadrant a while ago. This morning I finally remembered: the [Coffee Compass](https://baristahustle.com/blogs/barista-hustle/the-coffee-compass)! How could I not remember, it's an alliteration too! With this I'll try to make a better cup. If that doesn't work, I'll have to drink bitter coffee 1kg worth of beans...
