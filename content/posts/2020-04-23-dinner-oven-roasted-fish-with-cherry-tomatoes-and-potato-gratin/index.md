Yesterday's dinner was oven roasted cod with cherry tomatoes and shallots, with potato gratin and roasted asparagus. I followed the New York Times recipe for [One-Pan Roasted Fish with Cherry Tomatoes](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020454-one-pan-roasted-fish-with-cherry-tomatoes) and it's a wonderful dish. Will definitely make this again.
