I had a craving for peanut butter cookies and this [recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/peanut-butter-cookies/) was recommended to me. Of course I made them.

They are quite delicious but it has to be said this recipe makes a ton of dough. Like I baked not even half of it and that's already so many cookies. The other thing to note is that the cookies came out very crumbly despite being baked longer than the recipe asked for. Either my oven's thermostat is off or I did something wrong.

Next time I might bake them hotter or longer to get some more browning on them. Also, I wonder how they would taste with maple syrup instead of sugar.

All in all great cookies and I ate like 3 already and now I'm full and happy.
