Ordered new coffee beans from [Cafe Enrroca](https://www.cafeenrroca.com/). I ordered the _Marcala Organic_ and the _Marcala Organic Bourbon_ and they sent me a free sample which is nice.

I made a cup of the Marcala Organic Bourbon this morning with a slightly altered Aeropress recipe:

* 15 g of finely ground coffee (8/10)
* 85&deg;C water

1. Invert Aeropress
1. 30 second bloom with 50g of water
1. Add 180g of water, and stir
1. After one minute, press until the foam just hits the grounds

This gave me a very smooth and full bodied coffee. Very excited to try the other beans as well!
