Someone from the culinary team at work posted a recipe for a "skinny" banana bread and I had some over ripe bananas lying around so I gave it a try. We were quite impressed. The recipe calls for less sugar and less fat than our usual banana bread and yet it's very flavorful, probably because of the cinnamon.
