A coworker of mine posted a mouthwatering picture of crispy tofu in sauce. So obviously I asked for the [recipe](https://www.tablefortwoblog.com/pan-fried-sesame-garlic-tofu/).

I only had soft tofu which didn't work out too well, I had trouble coating the tofu because it kept falling apart, so next time at least medium or hard tofu.

Overall the flavor was not bad, but next time I'd throw in some green onion, garlic, and ginger before adding the sauce, just to give it a more complex flavor.
