We made pizza and they came out beautifully. Dough is based on [Joe Heffernan's Recipe](https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/life-changing-pizza-dough-with-joe-heffernan-of-seattle-s-independent-pizzeria) and was baked in hot preheated oven at 470&deg; F convection for three minutes and then broiled for 2 minutes.
