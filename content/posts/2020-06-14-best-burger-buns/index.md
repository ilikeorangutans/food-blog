We recently decided to have burgers for dinner but had no buns. A quick search led me to [King Arthur Flour's Recipe](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/beautiful-burger-buns-recipe) and boy did they not disappoint. These might be my favorite burger buns. They're soft, flavorful, and easy to make in relatively short time (for a yeasted bread that is). If you have yeast and a little time I highly recommend these. We've made them multiple times now, and they're delicious, even without sesame seed.
