Needed a veggie dish last night and I had chickpeas and cauliflower at hand, so I tried myself at an Indian curry. I didn't really have a recipe, just applied some basics I've learned about Indian food. The whole dish came out with a wonderful aroma and was very flavorful, I will definitely try to make this again. We ate it garnished with chopped cilantro over white rice, with some leftover lemon salmon and Avocado. I know, I know, not your classic Indian dish, but it was very tasty.

Here's the rough recipe I made.

## Ingredients

- head of cauliflower, cut into small florets
- two cans of chickpeas, drained
- one large onion, chopped
- one can of coconut milk
- cumin seeds
- turmeric
- white pepper
- half a stick of cinnamon
- ground coriander
- garlic powder
- a few bay leaves
- a little chicken stock, veggie stock would also work
- gee
- cilantro, coarsely chopped

## Method

1. Heat gee, toast spices in it
2. Add onion, and a little salt, cook until onion is browned
3. Deglace with chicken stock, add cauliflower, coconut milk
4. Simmer for a while until cauliflower almost soft
5. Add chickpeas and let simmer on low for a little
6. Adjust seasoning
7. Serve with fresh cilantro
