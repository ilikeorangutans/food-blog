Made [Kenji's basic square pan pizza](https://www.seriouseats.com/basic-square-pan-pizza-dough-recipe-sicilian-recipe) twice now and it's a hit. Paired with a simmered down pizza sauce it's a total crowd pleaser. Bonus points because I can make trays and trays of this a day or two ahead and then just top it and bake it. No fussing with dough that needs to be kneaded and shaped!

The pizza comes out almost like a focaccia, pillowy soft and slightly crunchy on the crust. I find that baking it at the temperature from the recipe burns it crispy within half the allotted baking time, so either the thermostat in my oven is off or it produces way too much radiant heat. In any case, ten minutes seems to be the sweet spot.

For the pizza sauce I take a single large can of tomatoes, tons of garlic, bit of olive oil, squeeze of tomato paste, pinch of sugar, dried basil, and puree it. Simmer it down and it's good for two pizzas.
